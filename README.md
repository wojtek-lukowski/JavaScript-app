# JavaScript-app

A training JavaScript app developed during the first Achievement of the CareerFoundry (https://careerfoundry.com) Full Stack Web Development course.

The app features the names of the Pokemons and **fetches the data via API** (from https://pokeapi.co) when a button with a name of an individual Pokemon is clicked, opening a modal with the name, height and image of the selected Pokemon.

The project involves **HTML, CSS and JavaScript** and **runs in the browser**.

There are two versions:
- "main" branch - built with Bootstrap;
- "original styling" branch - using vanilla HTML, CSS and JS only.
